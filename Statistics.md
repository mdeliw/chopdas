## Data Types and Graphs

### Quantitative  Data

- Info recorded as number and represents objective measurement or count. E.g. temp, weight, count of transactions. This is also called numerical data.
- Two categories:
  - Continuous data - can take any numerical value including fractions and decimal values. There are infinite number of possibilities between any two values. You can asses mean, median, distribution, range, and std deviation. Two types:
    - Interval scales - interval between two points, but doesn’t hav zero measurement that indicates lack of the characteristics, and can add / subtract but you can’t multiply / divide. E.g. 20-degree diff between 10 and 30 Celcius is equivalent to the diff between 50 and 70 degree Celsius. Also Celcius has a zero measure, but it doesn’t mean there is no temp.
    - Ratio scales - has zero measure. E.g. zero kg indicates lack of weight, and you can add/subtract as well as multiple/divide.
  - Histogram Distribution graph continuous variables

### Qualitative Data

- Info represents characteristics that you don’t measure with numbers, can fall into countable number of groups, is subjective. E.g. taste, eye color, marital status
