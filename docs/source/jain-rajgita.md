## Verse 79 - Disciple's doubt 1 - Karmas are devoid of the ability to know.

તે કર્મનું ભોક્તાપણું જીવને નહીં હોય, એમ શિષ્ય કહે છે:-

The 4th fundamental truth is that the soul is the receiver of the fruits of the karmas. At this point the disciple is convinced that the soul was the doer, but his first of two arguments is that it is impossible for the soul to receive the fruits of those karmas. 

> જીવ કર્મ કર્તા કહો, પણ ભોક્તા નહિ સોય; 
>
> શું સમજે જડ કર્મ કે, ફળ પરિણામી હોય ?
>
> Jeev karma kartaa kaho, pan bhoktaa nahi soy; 
>
> Shun samaje jad karma ke, fal parinaamee hoy?



Granted that the atma is the author of its karma, but it cannot be that it has to experience their fruits. How can lifeless karma be consciously effective as a giver of fruit?



- First line is acceptance of the 3rd fundamental truth, and the argument is in the second line.
- First line:
  - `Jeev karma karta kaho` - the soul is the doer of the karma (if you say so) - then I admit / accept / am convinced;  *Baba says to admit is for your ego, to accept is for your ignorance*
  - `pan bhoktaa nahin soy` - but receiver of the fruits of the karmas it (soul) can't be
- Second line:
  - `Shun samaje jad karma ke` - How can the lifeless / inanimate / non-sentient / material / (not a concious) karma particles know
  - `fal parinami hoy?` - that they should inflict the fruits of the karmas upon / giving results to the doer (to whom, where, when, how, and what type of fruit or what intensity of reward or punishment etc)

**Short meaning:**

<u>Disciple</u>: It can be accepted that the soul is the doer of the karma; I have rationally understood that if the soul abides in the awareness of its true nature then it is the doer of the manifestation of that nature, and if the soul doesn't abide in the awareness of its true nature (`nija bhaan ma na rahe`) - then it becomes the doer of the impure feelings and soul binds to the karma. 

Note: The 3rd fundamental truth states that atma karta che, it doesn't say atma is karma no karta. Alternatively think that soul's nature is a doership, but non-doer of impure feelings

*Bapa says from the relative viewpoint ( unattributed / `anupcharit vyahaar naya`) - the soul is the doer of the karmas. We should all know the absolute viewpoint (attributed / `upcharit vyahaar naya`) that we can harbor impure feelings and the rest happens due to the nature of substances in the Universe. You have a choice to get angry or not, and then everything follows automatically. The right choice is whether Dharma gives you refuge* - Samyak dharshan / Samyak charitra. 

Notes:

All substances have a functionality. We witness all substances conducting various fruitful activities. The soul is also active, and is thus an author of action. The Jinas have declared three types of such activity. From the `absolutist perspective`, realising its own self, it is the cause of its own self. From the perspective known as `Anupacharit` (that which can come into experience, with respect to a specific relationship) Convention (`Vyavahaar`), that soul is the author of physical (dravya) karma. By the perspective known as `Upcharit Convention`, it is the author of homes, towns and so on.

These two perspectives have formal technical definitions. 

- The first is technically known as `Anupacharit Asadbhut Vyavahaarnay`, which takes as it subject the relationship between two objects which are distinct yet associated by a specific relationship. While the soul and body are known to be distinct from each other, it is from this perspective that the soul describes the body as itself, by taking into account that they occupy the same space, which is their specific relationship. The same is true for the physical (`dravya`) karma accruing to the soul. 
- The second perspective is technically known as `Upacharit Asadbhut Vyavahaarnay`. This perspective describes two totally distinct objects as being one: When the soul places a sense of possessive identification, or its stamp of “me-and-mine”, on an object such as a horse, an elephant, or a home, all items which are totally distinct in nature from it. 

<u>Disciple</u>: but it doesn't make logical sense / I fail to understand (disciple has the vinay) how can inanimate matter (karmic particles) have the understanding to give fruits of the karmas to the doer in a particular way and at a particular time? My vinay is that because you say so, I can follow, but since you are telling me to understand before putting it into conduct, I am telling you that I don't understand it. I can understand that karmic particles can travel and stick, but I can't understand how it can decide when to bear consequences.

You need an entity that is intelligent, with perfect knowledge, and is sharp and a judging entity to make such a determination. Karma particles have no such attribute (knowingness). How does Karma particles know that they need to stick / be bound to which soul, and how do the karma particles know that in certain time they need to give fruits. What fruit to give, Whom to give, Where to give, Why to give, How much to give.  There is no giver, then how can there be a receiver?

Disciple’s example: A person wishes to take revenge, will plan intelligently to inflict it - karma must have intelligence of some sort to give back on earlier action. A clock can't think that right now the time is 11:25, though it is showing 11:25, but it itself doesn't know that it is showing 11:25. The clock doesn't have the ability to think, to convey, to inflict.

## Verse 80 - Disciple's doubt 2 - God is the bestower of fruits of karmas

The disciple is convinced that the soul was the doer, and that karma are devoid of the ability to know, and therefore can't give fruits of the karmas on their own. One must believe in the inspiration of some super concious entity, which can be no other than God. However assuming God is giver of karmas raises difficulties and breaks the disciple's understanding of the 3rd fundamental truth that the soul is the karta (of good and bad) - but once it attains state of liberation, the soul is not a karta of any karmas. Although the disciple already knows that his second argument is not valid, he doesn't know how to put it to rest.

> ફળદાતા ઈશ્વર ગણ્યે, ભોક્તાપણું સધાય; 
>
> એમ કહ્યે ઈશ્વરતણું, ઈશ્વરપણું જ જાય. 
>
> Faldaataa ishvar ganye, bhoktaapanun sadhaay; 
>
> Em kahyo ishvartanun, ishvarpanun ja jaay.

If we consider God to be the giver of fruits, we can accept that the soul experiences them, But if we say that about God, then his godliness is lost.

- First line, the disciple proposes an option to support the fundamental truth
- Second line, disciple says that the proposition is not reasonable.
- First line
  - `Faldaataa ishwar ganye` - the giver of the fruits of the karmas, If you take God to be
  - `bhoktaapanu` - Then the soul being the receiver
  - `sadhaay` - can be established
  
- Second line
  - `Em kahye Ishvartanu` - but by stating this - that the God is the giver of the fruits of the karmas,  this form of His Godliness
  - `Ishwarpanu ja jaay` - His Godliness goes away

**Short meaning**:

<u>Disciple</u>: If God is accepted as the bestower of the fruits of the karmas, then it can be established that the soul is the receiver of the fruits of the. However if this is accepted, God will lose His Godhood - i.e. Godliness can't be associated with Him. The assumption that God is the giver of karmas breaks the 3rd fundamental truth.

Specifically around God and His Godliness, Bapa emphasizes that KPD says `atma karta che`, this is not same as assuming that atma is karma no karta only or that at all times atma is karta of pure and impure feelings. What it means is that atma nu kartapanu remains even after the atma attains siddha hood - state of liberation. The doership remains, just that in state of liberation the karma nu karta is not possible.  The argument in this verse is the doership of karmas.

Example: state of liberation is like a plain book, every page is blank, there is doership.

In support of the disciple, Bapa says - the tendency to apply commonsense logic that doer of the karmas will receive the fruits of the karmas <u>should be kept aside</u>. Disciple is hinting that there is no such fixed correlation and 4 combinations exists between doer and receiver.

	-	non-doer / non-receiver: akarta / abhokta
	-	non-doer / receiver (chef cooks, I eat): akarta / bhokta
	-	doer / non-receive (check cooks, chef doesn't eat): karta / abhokta
	-	doer / receiver (check cooks, chek eats his food): karta / bhokta

If God is the giver of the fruits of the karmas to infinite souls, then God is like an accountant. Anant Jivo, kshan kshane are receiving the fruits of the karmas - so God is engaged in this wordly entanglement? We are reducing God to the state of a mere Judge. A judge who follows the rule of law, and the crime is punished at designated places (jail).

Bapa's examples:

- `3 Ds` - Judge `Decides`, `Dispenses`, and `Delivers` the consequences.

- Bollywood: The incomplete justice of the court is completed by the God. God sees the injustice.

- You want God to be Just and Compassionate at the same time? 

  - As a judge, god is just all knowing and implementor of that knowledge, you won't have devotion towards such a being. 
  - As a compassionate God, you can't control the tolerance HE has with compassionate.
  - We reduce God to "Uncalled Inter-menial botheration on God, by calling him a fruit-giver - managing, adjusting accounts of infinite souls"

- `Ashuchi bhavana` - nature of the body with all its dirtiness - human body is fantastic, complex, dirty - carries urine and faeces cover by skin. This Bhavana reflects the fact that the body is full of filth. Day by day we fill our mouths with food and drink which turns into waste. This waste stays in the body until it’s ready to expel it. So quite literally, the body is full of filth. The true nature of the body is to decay and age. We must cultivate the thought that the body is separate from the soul.  

  The composition of the body will reveal all the things we loathe, such as excrement, urine, blood, meat, bones, sweat, and so on, and therefore is impure. The Soul, within the body but unattached to the body, alone is pure. The body ultimately becomes non existent, but the Soul continues on, is eternal. The emotional attachments to the body is useless.

- `Bhag` means Godliness, and Godliness is expressed in 16 ways: ananth this and that. Bhogibhai relates this with his Sadguru in the book "Bhaktimarg nu rahasya", and the first verse begins with "Shri Sadguru Bhagwan".

- The law: you will be hanged was changed to you will be hanged until death and the revised to hande unto death via 5 amendments.

- Abhaydayanam - the bestower of fearlessness

## Verse 81 - A fallacious conclusion (disciple's confusion)

The thinking continues. If the giver of the fruits of the karmas is not God, then other difficulties arise. 

> ઈશ્વર સિદ્ધ થયા વિના, જગત નિયમ નહિ હોય; 
>
> પછી શુભાશુભ કર્મનાં, ભોગ્યસ્થાન નહિ કોય.
>
> Ishvar siddha thayaa vinaa, jagat niyam nahi hoy; 
>
> Pachhee shubhaashubha karmanaan, bhogyasthaan nahi koy.

- First line
  - `Ishwar siddha thaya vina` - if the existence of God is not accepted.
  - `Jagat niyam nahin hoy` - the world's management is not possible.
- Second line
  - `Pacchi shubhashubh karma na` - for fruition of good and bad karmas
  - `bhogyastan nahin koy` - there will be no places to obtain the results.

Without positing the existence of a god, there is no order in the universe. Hence there is no place to bear the fruits of good and bad karma.



**Short meaning**:

Without establishing the existence of God as the power that maintains order and system in the world, there will be anarchy and chaos everywhere. There will be no designated place such as heaven and hell to obtains the results of good and bad karmas. Since we haven't established a giver of fruits, the analogy is that there a receiver of karmas is not possible - because there is no designated place such as heaven and hell. 

Disciple is caught up fallaciously in the conclusion - by rejecting god, you are rejecting the soul as the receiver of the fruits of karmas, so if you wish to prove that the soul is the receiver of the fruits of the karmas, you have to bring back God into the equation. So disciple is unable to prove the 4th fundamental truth.

## Verse 82 - Cause and the process of bondage (Guru responds to doubt 1 in verse 79)

Samadhaan - Guru’s resolution

જીવને પોતાનાં કરેલાં કર્મનું ભોક્તાપણું છે, એમ સદ્ગુરુ સમાધાન કરે છે:

The Guru provides explanation in verse 82 through 84 to Disciple's first doubt, and in verse 85 and 86 to Disciple's second doubt. In verse 82 Guru explains the bondage of karma, and in verse 83 and 84, Guru explains the fruits of the bondage. 

The True Guru affirms that the soul must endure the karma it itself has bound:

> ભાવકર્મ નિજકલ્પના, માટે ચેતનરૂપ; 
>
> જીવવીર્યની સ્ફુરણા, ગ્રહણ કરે જડધૂપ
>
> Bhaavkarma nijakalpanaa, maate chetanroop; 
>
> Jeevaveeryanee sfurnaa, grahan kare jadadhoop

Karma-binding inclinations are a result of delusion which is thus an activity of consciousness. The positive and negative inclinations of the soul draw karmic particles

- First line
  - `Bhaavkarma nijakalpanaa`- impure feelings arises in the soul.
  - `maate chetanroop`- they are therefore concious; because impure feelings arise in soul, it also means chetan.
  - Its the bhavkarma that programs the mechanics into the karmic particles. Bapa explains the bit about bhavkarma (impure feelings) and dravyakarma (material karma). 
- Second line
  - `Jeevaveeryanee sfurnaa`- through soul's own vibrancy
  - `grahan kare`- is acquired causing bondage
  - `jadadhoop`-  of karmic matter (what is acquired?)

**Short meaning**:

Guru explains how and why the association with karmas take place. The soul's impure feelings like impulses, desires originate within the soul, and they are therefore concious acts. They induce soul's energy to work in attracting the karmic particles, resulting in its bondage to the soul. The passions of the soul are the cause of the bondage of the karmic particles. 

The impure feelings will decide how, where, when the karmic matters will give fruit. 
Example: you set the clock with alarm for 5:30AM. The clock simply reacts to what you set the clock for. 

The goal of the soul is to rise above the karmas - i.e. get to 4th gunasthanak (attain self-realization, samyak darshan), and when the soul get rid of all the karmas -it is the liberation of the 14th gunasthanak.

The consequences of the karma is called karma fal. Every action, every emotion, every thought will carry the burden of bondage, and each will bear fruits either in this life or next life.
Example: Gandhaari - wife of Dhritarasthra, mother of Duryodhana and Dushashan, sister of Shakuni from Gandhaar (today's pakistan). Unlike her husband who was wavering in his mind, and unlike her sons who were treachorus, she was a very pious women. In the battle of kurukshetra, her 100 sons fought against the pandavaas, and all were killed. So why for such a pious women - was such a tragic experience happening - because as a child when on top of the hill, she threw rocks on turtle eggs.

Example: Ganga Putra - Bhishma Pitamah - his vows were steadfast (Bhishma Pratigna). His could decide his own death, but held on until Hastinapur was secure - day of Uttaran 14-Jan. Why did he have to suffer all along his life? He lost this throne, had to live a life of celebacy inside the palace, and had challenging circumstances of lying on the bed of the arrow. In his previous birth, he was a celestial being named Prabhas. He stole the celetial cow Nandini from the Sage Vasishtha's (Guru of Lord Rama) ashram. (Note: Kalpavrusha, nandini, kamdhenu).  In the current birth, he had a good childhood - but such bhogantray karma - enjoyment obstructing karma.

`Karman Vargana` is a stage when the karmic particles are not yet bound to the soul and later when bound its called karma or `dravyakarma` - you can't acquire drayva karma, you can acquire karmic vargana and make it dravya karma. Remember that karman vargana is still within the same space as the soul.

> Bhaav karmaas are instrumental in bondage of karmas - you can't say the soul is instrumental because even the siddhas are souls, but don't have the bhaav karmaa. 

When the fruits come, they can either impact the state of the soul  (e.g. `mohaniya` karma) or the situation around the soul (e.g `gnaan` karma). The nature of soul is pure. Verse 78 - Chetan jo nij bhanma - if the soul is aware of its true nature - karta aap swabhaav - its the doer of the pure nature i.e. atmanusandhaan, swaroopanusandhaan, and chetan jo parbhaavma or bahirmukh - he becomes extrovert. PKD uses the word swaroopanusandhan because kundkund's teaching helped PKD.

- Pradesh Bandh - how much karma will be bound?
- Prakruti Bandh - what type of karma?
- how long?- Ashatana vediniya karma
- With what intensity?

## Verse 83 - Non-sentient matters shows effect without it knowing

Provides examples for verse 82 to understand how inanimate material gives fruits. Up until now, Bapa explains bonding and programming happens at the single instance - calling out example of gautam swami asking bhagwan mahavir - and explained in Tattva Sutra. In this there is a mention of a small granta called Gautam Pruchha (Gautam asks).

> ઝેર સુધા સમજે નહીં, જીવ ખાય ફળ થાય; 
>
> એમ શુભાશુભ કર્મનું, ભોક્તાપણું જણાય. 
>
> Zer sudhaa samaje naheen, jeev khaay fal thaay; 
>
> Em shubhaashubh karmanun, bhoktaapanun janaay.

Neither poison nor nectar is consciously effective; yet their consumption still impacts life. This is how we can understand the experience of good and bad karma.

- First line
  - `Zer sudhaa samaje naheen` - poison and nectar have no knowledge
  - `jeev khaay fal thaay` - person who consumes it experiences the results

- Second line
  - `Em shubhaashubh karmanun`- so with regards to good and bad deeds
  - `bhoktaapanun janaay`- the one who consumes the enjoyment or the suffering (the soul) will know. Soul bear the consequences of the good and bad deeds.

**Short meaning**:

- The inanimate substance need not know its own properties; It need not know who is consuming it, but the one who consumes it will see the results of it because of the nature of the substance. Examples chilly, salt, alcohol, anaesthesia.
- The inanimate substance is incapable of knowing the effects it will inflict on the one that consumes it.
- It debunks the logical reasoning that inanimate objects can't do anything. This is different from inanimate object not knowing anything.
- Every object is inbibed with some visible and invisible activity. **Arth Kriya Sampann Che.. sarva padarth**.
- So its important that the person that consumes this substance should know what it does to the person.
- Bapa explains his own heart surgey with effects of a jaad - anaesthesia.
- River gives shape to rocks and turns into round shape pebbles. River has no plan, but the hard rock just being in the stream goes through this transformation.

> All this is programmed by Bhaavkarma.

## Verse 84 - Never anything happens without a reason

In verse 82-84, Guru explains the process of karmic bondage, and proves that the accumulated karmas give fruits on their own at appropriate time. Guru gives one more example.

> એક રાંક ને એક નૃપ, એ આદિ જે ભેદ; 
>
> કારણ વિના ન કાર્યતે, તે જ શુભાશુભ વેદ્ય. 
>
> Ek raank ne ek nrup, e aadi je bhed; 
>
> Kaaran vinaa na kaarya te, te ja shubaashubha vedya.

- First line

  - `Ek raank ne ek nrup` - one person is poor, another is a king - `nrupati`: `nru` means human, `pati` means king. The word `nru` is used by PKD in many places. 

    > Nrupati jitata jitiye, dal, pur ne adhikaar
    > won over the king, then won over the army, kingdom, power

    Nrupachandra prapanch - means author's name. PKD used to wove author's name in the poems according to the prevailing system, and then he changed. In `Shubh shitalmay chhay rahi` - cool shade from the heat of the wordly life, `Nrupchandra prapanch anant daho`

    `P-P` - pauper and prince.

  - `e aadi je bhed` - similar differences are seen

- Second line

  - `Kaaran vinaa na kaarya te` - without cause there is no effect
  - `te ja shubhashubh vedya` - likewise the results of good and bad deeds are experienced.

One is born a king and one a pauper; there are many such disparities. There being no effect without a cause; such disparities must arise from good or bad karma.

**Short meaning**:

World consists of `3-Ds`: Differences, Disparities, and Diversities. To a common eye - not aware of the karmic theory, all this will seem as unjustifiable, discriminatory. No two ants are the same. The sowing path is invisible, but the reaping path is experential. So many things we can't see is because of jnanavarniya - knowledge obscuring karma. 

Rushabdev bhagwan's varshitap - year-long fast - same as 13 ghadi. 1 ghadi is 24 mins.

## Verse 85 - Karmas fruitify by their own nature

Guru's response to disciple's doubt number 2. In verse 80, disciple attributes give of fruits to be God, but then God would lose the godliness. That confusion is  resolved here. Remember the subject matter is whether God is the giver of the fruits of karma. Whether God created the universe etc is not the topic here. Guru proves that there is no need to hold Got responsible as the fruit giver. God doesn’t indulge in any occurrences. God is the knower of the souls, God is the knower of the soul’s bondage. He is the knower of the bondages being operative, God knows the soul is being liberated from karmas. HE knows everything, but doesn’t involve Himself in any occurrences. 

> ફળદાતા ઈશ્વરતણી, એમાં નથી જરૂર; 
>
> કર્મ સ્વભાવે પરિણમે, થાય ભોગથી દૂર. 
>
> Faladaataa ishvartanee, emaan nathee jaroor; 
>
> Karma svabhaave pariname, thaay bhogathee door.

As such there is no reason to posit a god as the cause; The nature of karma defines the experience; after which the karma is shed. 

- First line
  - Faldata ishwartani, ema nathi jaroor - fruit give as god is not necessary
- Second line
  - karma swabhave pariname - karma fruitify by their own nature
  - thay bhogthi dur - and exhaust as soon as they are experienced

**Short meaning**:

Karman vargana is neutral, gets charged by bhaavkarma  and get bound to the soul, and the programming happens on time, place, intensity etc, then it remains in state of dormancy, comes to fruition, and then more bhaavkarma  (e.g. mango takes time to ripe). The cycle continues, and we aren't aware of it. 

With Guru's help, intensity of bhaavkarma decreases, then the eruption of bhaavkarma decreases.

Question from Indiana - I step on ant unknowingly - is this bhaavkarma? Reference to michammi dukkaddam - janata <u>ane ajanata</u> kai pan bhool. Unawareness / Ajnaan is also called impure feeling, is also considered pramaad - otherwise all ignorance would be pardoned. 

- Energies of mind, speech, and body get destabilized.
- Karma creates its own laws of cause and effects. It maintains its unique balance of cause and effects, its own justice.
- Cause - Effect; effect becomes cause etc.
- If observed minutely, every situation is a consequence of an operative karma (karma uday) - karma which is not in dormant state.
- shätä vedaniya - pleasure producing karma
- ashata vedaniya - pain inflicting karma
- The lifespan you have right now until 10:37AM is a karma that is geting exhausted right now, and is getting detached from the soul.
- When karma exhaust, the potency it has to inflict results is gone. If you remove venom from the snake, the snake becomes a large harmless worm, powerless, nirmälya or shaktihën. This is the same concept when we remove the ängi decorations from the jain temple - because those decorations have become shaktihën. 
  - Similarility between snake whose venom is being removed, and karma - whose potency is removed it becomes kärman varganä
  - “thäy bhogthi dur” - they are released from the soul (because now it has show / inflicted its results), and the soul is now free of the karmas.
  - As a small seed matures into a fruit, the karmic particles mature into manifestation of karma / karmic fruits
- Some more reading on antrayay karma. 
- Meditation = knowing, not doing. Consciouness should be at its peak, and not with impure feelings of likes and dislikes.

## Verse 86 - Deep subject has been spoken of briefly

Having convinced the disciple that there is no need to assume God is the fruit giver, the continuation of verse 81 is that if God is not the fruit giver, and if such a god doesn’t exist - then no law will prevail in the world, and hence there is no designated place like heaven and hell to obtain the fruits of one’s deeds. The scope is whether the soul can receive the fruits of actions or not. Guru solves this confusion.

> તે તે ભોગ્ય વિશેષનાં, સ્થાનક દ્રવ્ય સ્વભાવ; 
>
> ગહન વાત છે શિષ્ય આ, કહી સંક્ષેપે સાવ. 
>
> Te te bhogya visheshnaan, sthaanak dravya svabhaav; 
>
> Gahan vaat chhe shishya aa, kahee sankshepe saav.

First line

- Te Te - In order that the soul
- Bhogya visheshna - experiences the fruits of its karmas
- Sthanak dravya swabhav - there are designated place due to the self-nature of the substances
- Gahan vaat chhe Shisya aa - the subject matter is very deep O disciple
- Kahi sankshepe saav - has been spoken of briefly

There is a specific place for each experience, depending on the nature of karmic matter. This is a complex subject, O! disciple, it is outlined only briefly here.

**Short meaning**:

The soul experiences the fruits of karmas (in the form of enjoyment and sufferings), there are associated places and forms through their inherent self-nature. The topic is vast and deep, but it has been stated very briefly (just a glimpse) over here for you to understand <u>at your level</u> for your immediate  needs. This is a deep knowledge topic, and you have to go deep into karmic philosophy and read other scriptures to understand the immense territory of karma. You need to know much more about the nature of sentient and non-sentient substances (karnanuyog - Jain metaphysics ). Disciple, its not your perogative, your right, your power, your privilege, your ability to draw conclusions regarding the soul with that limited knowlede you have.

- Does the soul receive its fruits in some abode?  Dev, Naarki, manushya, and Tiryanch
- Soul has to be associated with designated places to experience the results of the impure feelings he has harboured.
- Does the abode have enough space to house the souls to bear the fruits of their karmas?
- Who takes the soul to the abode? - the soul goes on its own under the influence of its karmas
- Who created the abode? 
- Who had the imagination of heaven and hell and their respective context of pleasure and sufferings. (Example genocide, and causing slow and painful death)
- Other scriptures : karmagranth, tattvashutra
- Bapa compares to yoga: adho / adholok (go down), Urdhva / Urdhvalok (go up) or in the middle - madhya.
- Soul and matter both have limitless power, and when in union / association - they create different modifications in the feelings and in the universe
- Big bang made the first sound `Om`.
- All acts and intentions will carry a seed of merit and demerit

# Fifth fundamental truth - There is liberation

## Verse 87 - Disciple’s doubt no 1 - There is no liberation - as impurity continues to prevail

Shankaa: 

જીવનો તે કર્મથી મોક્ષ નથી, એમ શિષ્ય કહે છે:

Disciple presents argument in support of his doubt regarding the fifth fundamental truth - “There is liberation”. 

> કર્તા ભોક્તા જીવ હો, પણ તેનો નહિ મોક્ષ; 
>
> વીત્યો કાળ અનંત પણ, વર્તમાન છે દોષ. 
>
> Kartaa bhoktaa jeev ho, pan teno nahi moksha; 
>
> Veetyo kaal anant pan, vartamaan chhe dosh.

The atma may be the author of its karmas and may experience their fruits, but there is no Moksha. Infinite time has elapsed, and its impurity still remains. 

First line

- Karta bhokta jiva ho, pan teno nahi moksh - Doer and receiver of karmas - the soul may be, but there is no liberation from it.

Second line

- Vityo kaal anant pan, vartaman chhe dosh - Infinite time has passed, and yet impurity still continues or present / future is filled with impurities

Short meaning:

- absolute freedom from cycle of bondage is not possible because impurities still continue and soul has not attained moksh till date. So although you can shed karmas, the cycle of bondage causes you to acquire more karmas and the cycle doesn’t end. Bondage is beginning-less and end-less.
- hence passage of time or change in situation will not have any impact the soul
- disciple’s approach feels logical given the limited understanding he has, and is clouded by a judgement that his intelligence is high.
  - what was there, is there, and will be there - the bondage is endless
    - Guru: KPD focuses on Vairagya and Upsham - the nature to react
  - though i am convinced that the soul is the doer and receiver of the karmas, I am not convinced about the liberation of the soul
  - liberation is an illusion
  - we are conditioned to react to favorable and unfavorable situations - like automatic gears - we experience it, we realize we shouldn’t have reacted, we observe the same in others.
    - Guru: when did you do introspection?, you come to satsangs, and still ask me show my faults - you can’t even see and realize your faults?
    - With increased introspection, you don’t need your Guru to physically be with you or verbally talk to you.
    - With Satguru in your life, you should stop using the word confusion (frustration can increase)
    - Someone else didn’t write your destiny, you did. You didn’t excercise the power of discretion in a right way.
    - 4 Ts - Trust, Thank, Think Try
    - Every man, vachan, kaya will bear the fruit
    - Mitti me savva bhuesu - my friendship with all living beings
    - Veram majjham na kenai - I have enmity towards none
  - Even if I am heaven or hell, I don’t realize to fix my mistakes: desires lead to other desires, and with suffering, don’t learn to avoid mistakes.
- Most of his logic is based on wrong assumptions from purva mimansa / Uttarva mimansa.
  - purva - earlier part of scripture - worships and rituals
  - uttarva - later part of scripture

## Verse 88 - Disciple’s doubt no 2 - Soul is nowhere without karmas

Looking at the transmigration of worldy souls in the four states of existence (gati), another logical argument supporting his arguments:

> શુભ કરે ફળ ભોગવે, દેવાદિ ગતિ માંય; 
>
> અશુભ કરે નરકાદિ ફળ, કર્મ રહિત ન ક્યાંય. 
>
> Shubh kare fal bhogave, devaadi gati maayn; 
>
> Ashubh kare narakaadi fal, karma rahit na kyayn. 

If we do good, we enjoy its fruits in a celestial abode; If we do bad, we suffer in hellish existence; 

nowhere are we free from karma. 

First line

- Shubh karey fal bhogave, devadi gatimai - if it does auspicious karmas, it enjoys their fruits in state of heaven

Second line

- Ashubh karey narkadi fal  - if it does inauspicious karmas, bears the fruit in hell.
- karma rahit na kyai - Nowhere is it without karmas

Short meaning:

- Never / nowhere is the soul found without karmas in any state of existence
- All gati’s have shedding and acquiring of karmas, so where is the question of attaining moksh - this is influenced by the Purva Mimansa philosophy - because that only talks about heaven and hell
- In all the 4 gatis I don’t see any soul `karma-less` - this observation is bit different from a liberated soul - which is Gyani - Deh chhata nirvaan, videhi mukta, jivan mukta - all meanings of liberated - though in a body
- The disciple demoans the fate of the soul - there is no end to the transmigration, both good and bad are just shackles
- So what does liberation mean? - break from both types of shackles, freedom from all forms of shackles
- Bandh moksha chhe kalpana, speaks big under the force of delusion
- Kashay ne shantata matra moksha abhilasha
- Karma-less means two things (KPD will explain in two categories version 98 - 104)
  - Totally free of karmas or..
  - staying in the pure soul state

## Verse 89 - Reply to doubt no 1 - Cessation of karmas is liberation

Samaadhaan:

(તે કર્મથી જીવનો મોક્ષ થઈ શકે છે, એમ સદ્ગુરુ સમાધાન કરે છે. The True Guru affirms that the soul can be free from this karma:-

In this verse Guru will prove that liberation exists. In the next verse, Guru will explain why liberation has not been attained, and what should be done to attain it.

> જેમ શુભાશુભ કર્મપદ, જાણ્યાં સફળ પ્રમાણ; 
>
> તેમ નિવૃત્તિ સફળતા, માટે મોક્ષ સુજાણ. 
>
> Jem shubhaashubha karmapad, jaanyaan safal pramaan; 
>
> Tem nivrutti safaltaa, maate moksha sujaan. 

Just as we have seen that good and bad karma bear fruit; Abstaining from them is also fruitful; know this to be Moksha. 

- Jem shubhashub karmapada - Just as good and bad karmas
- janya safal praman - bear fruits for the soul, janya - you are convinced, safal - fruitful, praman means sufficient proofs
- Tem nivrutti safalta - Similarly cessation of karmas is also fruitful. The emphasis is that doing is fruitful, similarly `nivrutti - retiring, refraining, retreating, withdrawing, eliminating`. Nivrutti is also safal
- matey moksh - there is therefore liberation - fruits of nivrutti
- sujaan - O knowledgeable one / intelligent one - Guru is very loving towards the disciple. Su - properly, jaan - understand, the seeker is sujaan or wise

Short meaning:

The disciple incorrectly links the doubts of liberation to the second fundamental truth that the soul has been there since eternity and will be there for eternity; hence bondage has no beginning and no end. 

Bapa starts with KPD’s scriptures which talk about the samadhi state of KPD - “aa atma uttam gati pamva no chhe” - what does uttam gati mean?

- From a worldly point - dev gati / celestial birth is supreme - Dev lok Vaimanik dev (not Bhavanpati or Vyantar) - there a categories of celestial beings
- From a religious point - manushya gati is supreme - Mahavideh Kshetra region
- Scriptures say a soul has gone twice the time to heaven compared to hell, and the manushya gati has been received very less.
- Which gati has no karmas - no dravya karma and no bhaav karma
- Key is `Maatra Moksha Abhilash`, not seva and satsang - just proximity to a Guru will not remove your instincts locally, and once with proximity you will desire liberation and not proximity
- Types of philosophies - keval advaita vendata, vishisht advaita vedanta
- All religions focus on something exists and something extinct. Jain philosophy believes in individuality even in moksha - Siddha moksha Shashwat padey 
- Disciple, due to merging interpretations of several scriptures is confused - and Guru is anchoring jain philosophy
- `Dharma no ulaas rako, punya no nahin` - though both dharma and punya are good karmas - but both are not same.
  - You don’t realize
  - You realize but want to defend
  - You realize your contributions and what is wrong is wrong, why did I do that?
- While activity is inescapable and inevitable till you have mind, speech, body - but there is a manner to perform that activity. You have to perform the activity in the right way - devoid of ego and expectations, attachments, desires etcs
- Activity without attachment is nivrutti
- Every action has some fruit - no action is without fruit. Third and fourth principle focuses on shubhashubh activity and shubhashubh fruits. In the fifth principle, its the same - a withdrawing activity also bears fruits
- Remember
  -  `nivrutti safalta` - withdrawing also has its consequences.
  - `nivrutti - retiring, refraining, retreating, withdrawing, eliminating`
  - moksha is result of elimination of karmas, there is no such thing as some types of karmas will give you liberation
  - `Jem Jem` - liberation is not instant, first you will get rid of mithyatva, avirati, praman, kashay, activity of body, mind
    - with mithyatva going - achieve partial liberation
    - passionless state - 13th gunasthanak
    - karmaless state - 14th gunasthanak

## Verse 90 - Liberation arises on snapping the impure feelings

Guru continues to clarify doubt 1 - now focussing how liberation can be attained.

> વીત્યો કાળ અનંત તે, કર્મ શુભાશુભ ભાવ; 
>
> તેહ શુભાશુભ છેદતાં, ઊપજે મોક્ષ સ્વભાવ. 
>
> Veetyo kaal anant te, karma shubhaashubha bhaav; 
>
> Teh shubhaashubha chhedtaan, upaje moksha svabhaav.

 Infinite time has elapsed due to good and bad inclinations. Eliminating these leads to Moksha, our true nature. 

- Vityao kaal anant te - passed away infinite time
- karma shubhashubh bhaav - indulging in ausipicious and inauspicious feelings

- Teh shubhashubh chhedta - By destroying it
- upuje moksh swabhaav - arises state of liberation which is the nature of the soul. 
  - Bapa - there is nothing like moksh swabhaav - moksh is a state, but in that state, the purity is your inherent nature.
  - Moksh means mukavu, but `without association` is the nature.  

Short meaning:

- 22 verses to explain path to liberation
- The reply to doubt no 6 is end of all doubts
- Web of cause and effect
- Start with “don’t want to give in to my desires, let me try”
- Key is detachment  from desires and ego - vairaagya: 
  - viraag means sense of disassociation; 
  - any desire to benefit self is selfish - so karuna and vitraagta go hand in hand, can’t be separated
  - attachment for only one - vishesh rag - means that special form of disassociation is detachment.
  - first route: (2008)
    - Nemiji’s route - Love for one allows detachment to everything else
    - Vairaagya
    - Renunciation
  - second route: (2016)
    - contemplation (via introspection on right and wrong)
    - renunciation
    - vairaagya
- New term `shudha bhaav` replaces shubhashubha bhaav
- `E-E` - Engaging and Earning
- Soul has never attempted the work necessary for liberation
- “Grace is for inspiring me. So that I can understand the mathematics”
- Outcomes refraining from impure feelings and abiding in soul’s true nature is:
  - `Samvar and Nirjara` (which is dharma)
  - You stop incurring new bondage
  - You shed old karmas
- Boiling water is a distorted state of water
  - Log is the karma
  - Flames are the passions of likes an dislikes

## Verse 91 - Reply to doubt no 2 - Concept of liberation

> દેહાદિક સંયોગનો, આત્યંતિક વિયોગ; 
>
> સિદ્ધ મોક્ષ શાશ્વત પદે, નિજ અનંત સુખભોગ. 
>
> Dehaadik sanyogno, aatyantik viyog; 
>
> Siddha moksha shaashvat pade, nij anant sukhabhog. 

With complete separation from associations such as the body, Pure atma, in the eternal state of Moksha, experiences its own infinite bliss. 

- Dehadik sanyogno - Of body and other associations. Deh-adik means body and other things such as family, house, car etc
- atyantik viyog - total disassociation / separation. atyantik means total, viyog means separation

- Siddha moksha - State of siddhi-hood is accomplished
- shashwat padey - which is permanent
- nij anant sukhbhog - where it enjoys its own bliss

Short meaning:

- Many visitors come to visit one patient in the hospital. Have you come to Satsang as a patient or a visitor (antar bhed na kai)?

- Falibhut means fruitful.
- Activity is the nature of the soul (3rd fundamental) - abiding in the soul is also an activity
- What do you need to withdraw from? `shubhashubh` activity. Both shubh and ashubh need karma binding feelings in you - and that is not your true nature. But you can’t say that shubh is absolutely not helpful towards liberation; however you can say that ashubh is absolutely not helpful towards liberation.
  - There are two types of shubh (punya): 
    - paapa-nu-bandh-punya - gives material association
    - punya-nu-bandh-punya - will also give association, but also manushya bhav, Sadguru’s association, Shastra’s association
- Namokar says `sava paav pana shano` - and only includes ashubh, and doesn’t include shubh as a activity to be destroyed. The above explanation gives light into why shubh is necessary to be continued activity, but ashubh is not. Its easy to be misled to believe and it is easy to give up shubh assuming that it needs to be destroyed. For. e.g. stop doing ayembil - since its a shubh activity.  The order of steps towards the path is very important.
  - To destroy the paap, you need to take help of punya - though punya will incur karmas. E.g. thieves enter your home, will you call police or not? Now what - after thieves are taken away from the home - even the police has to leave the home.
  - You start decreasing paap, and then with deeper understanding `swaroop anu sandhan`
- Soul hasn’t been acustomed to self-awareness because `nirvikalp anubhuti` only lasts for a short time, but the connection `anusandhaan` lingers for a long time. Self-awareness is required during activity and during non-visible activity
-  5th says “From the unattributed actual approach, soul is the doer of material karma - karta panu, and being a doer, it is subject to its consequences - bhokta panu” - there is also a Talva panu - possibility to eliminate it or destroy that tendency - the non-self tendencies - vaibhaavic vruti. 
  - The soul is said to author karma according to the convention known as `anupcharit vyavahaar`. Due to this authorship the soul endures karma. This authorship is capable of cessation. While there is intensity of the passions, by refraining from them, reducing familiarity with them, by calming them, this intensity is diluted. These passions appear capable of elimination, and can be gradually eliminated. These binding inclinations being capable of elimination, devoid of them, the pure state of the atma's true nature, is the state of Moksha. 
  - How? `three words` - `anabhyaas` - discontinuance of practice, `aparichay` - avoiding contact, staying away from it, and `upsham` - by calming them down.
  - The 6th fundamental is 27 verses of which 5 are disciple’s doubts and 22 are Guru’s explanations. Verse 97 - 107 and 108 to 118

What is the connection between verse 90 and verse 91? 

- In 90, he spoke of non-physical liberation (bhaav moksh) - when one attains moksh, what happens within the soul? no feelings of shubhashubh - inner viewpoint. Generally all agree with this concept
- In 91, he spoke of physical liberation (dravya moksh) - when one attains moksh, what happens with the soul? no body, no karma, no material association - all outer viewpoint. Generally not well understood
