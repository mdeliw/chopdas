# Models

## Types of Learning

### Unsupervised Learning

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)
- [Medium - Cluster Analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-machine-learning-clustering-analysis-d40f2b34ae7e)
- Learn patterns from untagged data
- Methods used in UL include Neural Networks, Probablistic Methods
- Concepts: neuronal predilections also called probablistic densities

#### Probablistic densities

-

### Supervised Learning

- [Medium - Linear Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-learning-basics-of-linear-regression-1cbab48d0eba)

- Capture patterns where data is tagged by humans

### Semi-supervised Learning


### Reinforcement Learning

## Variables

### Quantitative Variables

- Categorical - contains finite number of categories or distinct groups. E.g. Gender, Type, Payment Method etc
- Discrete - numeric variables that have a countable number of values between any two values. Eg. number of customer complains or number of defects
- Continuous - numeric variables that have an infinite number of values between any two values. Eg. Length of a part or the date and time a payment is received.
